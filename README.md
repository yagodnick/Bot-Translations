# Translations
Hey! This repo holds all translations for the SCPStats bot. If you want it to support your language, then create a new lang file and PR it. You can see more info at https://github.com/SCPStats/Bot-Translations/blob/master/Messages.md. You'll also get a special Translator role on the website if you message me about it

## PLEASE READ
There is a translation called `lang_thislang`, which is set to `English` in `en.lang`. This shouldn't be translated, but instead replaced with the name of the language you are translating. It will be displayed as the language's name under the !lang command.

Under the help section, you'll notice that the command usage is included. If it makes sense to change it, then change it and an alias will be added for the command.
